# Event Geometry and Anisotropic Flow in Proton-Proton Collisions
This is my bachelors thesis in theoretical physics from Lund University.
Here I develope a model for generating the initial conditions of proton 
coliisions from the intersection of two 2D Gaussians.

This was the project that made me fall in love with programming,
but at the time I was not very good at it. So please forgive all the
bad code in the Jupyter Notebook and read the PDF for more information.
